        <p class="col-sm-6">Berkeley High Ultimate Frisbee was founded in 2007
          by a group of students. Since its inception, Berkeley High Coup has
          expanded into three seperate teams: the varsity team, Red, the jv
          team, Yellow, and most recently an all freshman boy's team called
          Lo Coup. In recent years, Red has fielded very successful teams,
          winning the state championship in 2013, 2014, and 2016. This year,
          Red took second at the Spaghetti Western tournament, in front of all
          other California teams.</p>
        <p class="col-sm-6">One fundamental part of High Coup's team culture is
          to perform a Haiku for their opponents after every game. It is a
          demonstration of Ultimate Frisbee's value of Spirit of the Game,
          which stresses being an honorable opponent and playing fair. However,
          Spirit of the game is about more than just responsibility. It is also
          about having fun playing a sport that you love. This year High Coup
          was truly a family that loved eachother</p>
